# AudioAnomalyDetection
# Insight Data Science Machine Learning Project
• Built a predictive model in 2 weeks to detect sound anomalies for a YC backed surveillance robotic company.
• Designed a sliding-window approach based on spectrum analysis of audio signals, engineered sound features from spectrograms and utilized PCA for dimensionality reduction; applied over-sampling to cope with imbalanced dataset.
• Applied machine learning techniques to predict unusual sound events out of the background noise using a Random Forest model in Scikit-Learn, achieving 86% precision and recall on test data.
• Provided company with actionable insights; final model will be incorporated into core product (deployed onto robots)
